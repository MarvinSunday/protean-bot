/**
 * Real, working implementation of back() - placing a confidential bet.
 * Kept in its own file, not folded into market.js, because this is
 * genuinely different infrastructure: every other action in this
 * folder is a plain viem writeContract call, but back() needs a
 * client-side FHE encryption step first, via the real
 * @zama-fhe/relayer-sdk package.
 *
 * IMPORTANT, confirmed directly from OpportunityMarket.sol's real
 * back() signature: it takes TWO SEPARATE proofs (targetProof,
 * amountProof), not one shared proof covering both values. This means
 * building one combined multi-value encrypted input (the more common
 * pattern shown in most fhEVM examples, e.g. one input with both
 * .add32() and .add64() calls producing a single shared inputProof)
 * would NOT work here - each value needs its own independent
 * createEncryptedInput() call, each producing its own handle+proof
 * pair, matching what the contract's two separate FHE.fromExternal
 * calls each expect.
 *
 * The FHE instance itself (createInstance) is expensive to set up (it
 * fetches public keys from Zama's relayer) - cached as a singleton and
 * reused across calls, same pattern as this bot's other lazily-
 * initialized clients (see kmsWallet.js's getKmsClient).

 * second, wasteful one - createInstance() is expensive (fetches public
 * keys from Zama's relayer), so this singleton is meant to be shared
 * across every FHE operation in this folder, not just back().
 *
 * If createInstance() ever fails - even a single transient hiccup on
 * Zama's relayer, at startup or any other time - the cached promise
 * must be cleared, not kept. Without this, a promise that rejects once
 * stays cached and rejected forever: every future call (checking
 * `!fhevmInstancePromise`) would see it as already set and reuse the
 * same broken promise for the rest of the process's life, even long
 * after Zama's relayer recovers, until the next full restart. This is
 * a real bug that was found and fixed directly - not a theoretical
 * concern - because it would turn one transient external failure into
 * a permanent one for every user, for every FHE operation, until
